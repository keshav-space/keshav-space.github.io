<h2 id="issue-reportingfeature-requests">Issue reporting/feature requests</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Already reported</strong>? Browse the <a href="https://github.com/keshav-space/safe_notes/issues">existing issues</a> to make sure your issue/feature hasn’t been reported/requested.</li>
  <li><strong>Already fixed</strong>? Check whether your issue/feature is already fixed/implemented.</li>
  <li><strong>Still relevant</strong>? Check if the issue still exists in the latest release/beta version.</li>
  <li><strong>Can you fix it</strong>? If you are an Android/Java/Flutter developer, you are always welcome to fix an issue or implement a feature yourself. PRs welcome! See <a href="#code-contribution">Code contribution</a> for more info.</li>
  <li><strong>Is it in English</strong>? Issues in other languages will be ignored unless someone translates them.</li>
  <li><strong>Is it one issue</strong>? Multiple issues require multiple reports, that can be linked to track their statuses.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="code-contribution">Code contribution</h2>

<h3 id="guidelines">Guidelines</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Stick to Safe Notes’s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">minimalist style</code>.</li>
  <li>Stick to <a href="https://play.google.com/about/developer-content-policy/">Google developer guidelines</a>.</li>
  <li>In particular <strong>do not bring non-free software</strong> (e.g. binary blobs) into the project.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="before-starting-development">Before starting development</h3>

<ul>
  <li>If you want to help out with an existing bug report or feature request, <strong>leave a comment</strong> on that issue saying you want to try your hand at it.</li>
  <li>If there is no existing issue for what you want to work on, <strong>open a new one</strong>  describing the changes you are planning to introduce. This gives the team and the community a chance to give <strong>feedback</strong> before you spend time on something that is already in development, should be done differently, or should be avoided completely.</li>
  <li>Please show <strong>intention to maintain your features</strong> and code after you contribute a PR. Unmaintained code is a hassle for core developers. If you do not intend to maintain features you plan to contribute, please rethink your submission, or clearly state that in the PR description.</li>
  <li>Create PRs that cover only <strong>one specific issue/solution/bug</strong>. Do not create PRs that are huge monoliths and could have been split into multiple independent contributions.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="flutter-in-safe-notes">Flutter in Safe Notes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Safe Notes will remain mostly Flutter for time being</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="creating-a-pull-request-pr">Creating a Pull Request (PR)</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Make changes on a <strong>separate branch</strong> with a meaningful name, not on the <em>master</em> branch or the <em>dev</em> branch. This is commonly known as <em>feature branch workflow</em>. You may then send your changes as a pull request (PR) on GitHub.</li>
  <li>Please <strong>test</strong> (compile and run) your code before submitting changes! Ideally, provide test feedback in the PR description. Untested code will <strong>not</strong> be merged!</li>
  <li>Respond if someone requests changes or otherwise raises issues about your PRs.</li>
  <li>Try to figure out yourself why builds on our CI fail.</li>
  <li>Make sure your PR is <strong>up-to-date</strong> with the rest of the code. Often, a simple click on “Update branch” will do the job, but if not, you must resolve the conflicts on your own. Doing this makes the maintainers’ job way easier.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="communication">Communication</h2>

<ul>
  <li>The #safenotes channel on <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#safenotes:matrix.org">Matrix Chat</a> has the core team and other developers in it.</li>
  <li>Some convenient Matrix clients, available both for phone and desktop, are listed at that link.</li>
  <li>You can post your suggestions, changes, ideas etc. on either <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GitHub</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Matrix</code>.</li>
</ul>
